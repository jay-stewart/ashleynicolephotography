            <p>Ashley is a Winnipeg based lifestyle photographer, but often travels beyond. While she primarily shoots weddings and newborns, she also enjoys maternity, lifestyle and event photography.  Ashley resides in Winnipeg with her spouse and their son and lives for the hot Manitoba summers and prairie sunsets.  Ashley&#8217;s photography style is primarily natural light and photojournalistic, aiming to tell each person&#8217;s individual story through photos.  Growing up, Ashley had a love for family photo albums and taking pictures.  In 2009 she travelled to Nepal with a friend to volunteer and further fell in love with her hobby, photographing some of the most beautiful sights in the world.</p>
